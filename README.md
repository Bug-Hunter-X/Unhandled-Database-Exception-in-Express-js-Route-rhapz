This repository demonstrates an example of an unhandled database exception in an Express.js application. The `/users/:id` route attempts to fetch user data from a database.  If the database operation fails (e.g., due to a network error or database unavailability), the application crashes without proper error handling. The solution implements error handling using try...catch and sends appropriate error responses.
